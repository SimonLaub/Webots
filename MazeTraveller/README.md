Maze Traveller.<br>
<br>
In this exercise we are again looking at an e-puck<br> working its way around a maze.<br>
<br>
Wall following is again useful<br>
(Just as it was in the prevous <a href="../MazeSolver/README.md">Maze Solver</a> exercise). <br>
See: Template code (E-puck, Webot):<br>
<a href="maze_traveller.py">Wall Following</a> (Finding the target box).<br>
<br>
Exercise:<br>
The robot must first find the box.<br> And
 then it must use its map of the world to find its way home. <br>As directly as possible.<br>
 <br>
For more: <br>See the <a href="MazeTraveller.pdf">Maze traveller</a> exercise (pdf).<br>
