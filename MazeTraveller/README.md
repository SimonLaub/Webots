Maze Traveller.<br>
<br>
In this exercise we are again looking at an e-puck<br> working its way around a maze.
<br>
Wall following is again useful<br>
(Just as it was in the prevous <a href="../MazeSolver/README.md">Maze Solver</a> exercise. 
E.g.<br>
<blockquote><i><b>Hand On Wall Rule</b></i>, also known as either the left-hand rule or the right-hand rule. If the maze is simply connected, that is, all its walls are connected together or to the maze's outer boundary, then by keeping one hand in contact with one wall of the maze the solver is guaranteed not to get lost and will reach a different exit if there is one; otherwise, the algorithm will return to the entrance having traversed every corridor next to that connected section of walls at least once.

Exercise:<br>
The robot must first find the box.<br> And
 then it must use its map of the world to find its way home. <br>As directly as possible.
