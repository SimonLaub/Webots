Maze Traveller.<br>
<br>
In this exercise we are again looking at an e-puck<br> working its way around a maze.<br>
<br>
Wall following is again useful<br>
(Just as it was in the prevous <a href="../MazeSolver/README.md">Maze Solver</a> exercise. <br>
For more, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze-solving_algorithm" target="_blank">Maze solvers</a> (Wikipedia).<br>

<br>
Exercise:<br>
The robot must first find the box.<br> And
 then it must use its map of the world to find its way home. <br>As directly as possible.
